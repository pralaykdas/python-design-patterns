## Intent:
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance,
while providing a global access point to this instance.

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:
1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance.
2. Provide a global access point to that instance.
